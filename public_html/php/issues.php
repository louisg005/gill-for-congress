		<h3>(Veterans)Politicians Use Veterans as Tools</h3>
		<p>Make veterans a true priority rather than another talking point. Career politicians of both parties recognize that they can score points with voters by expressing support for vets. But this is just cynical maneuvering when those same politicians put the desires of Wall Street ahead of the needs of veterans. Wall Street and large corporations fund the pols, and the pols make them their top priority.</p>

		<h3>(Trade)"Free" Trade Crushes Most Americans</h3>
		<p>First NAFTA, now the TPP-- politicians of both major parties work for their corporate masters. After almost 25 years, there is no doubt that such trade agreements send our jobs overseas. And yet, here we go again with the Trans-Pacific Partnership-- this one stinks so bad that they've had to keep the details of the agreement a secret from us. And not only do such deals bring great economic harm-- they are written in a way that ultimately costs us our sovereignty as a nation. Our laws become meaningless when we allow trade agreements to circumvent and supercede our laws.</p>

		<h3>(Taxes)Taxed Enough Already</h3>
		<p>When we no longer have representatives owned by oil companies, arms manufacturers, insurance and drug companies, and Wall Street banks, we can have an economy and tax system that works to the benefit of ordinary Americans. As long as we continue to elect Republicans and Democrats who serve their corporate masters, we will continue to be over-taxed and under-served.</p>

		<h3>(Reproductive Health)Keep the Government Out</h3>
		<p>As a physician, I've provided care to thousands of pregnant women. Politicians have no idea of the details and the complexity of the situations presented into the lives of these women. Accordingly, representatives in Congress should stay out of such business, and leave the decision-making to the pregnant women themselves.</p>

		<h3>(Politics)TIME FOR TERM LIMITS</h3>
		<p>Both parties want to maintain their positions of royalty. Dr. Gill has long argued for term limits on U.S. Representatives and Senators, as a means of working toward restoring our democracy. He has long questioned both major political parties, and as he watched the national Democrats abandon the citizens of IL-13 after the general election of 2012, it became painfully clear to Gill that there will be no improvement in Americans' lives until we abandon both parties and install true independents in positions of leadership.</p>

		<h3>(Marriage Equality) It's About Time</h3>
		<p>As a longtime champion of marriage equality, Dr. Gill was very pleased with the recent Supreme Court decision which finally corrected the stubborn and unconstitutional position of politicians such as Rodney Davis.</p>

		<h3>(Jobs)Mission Impossible with Politicians Owned by Wall Street</h3>
		<p>As with all other issues, economic growth and job development have been destroyed by politicians who take big contributions from Corporate America and then do the bidding of their corporate masters.  NAFTA did exactly as Ross Perot predicted back in 1992, sucking millions of good jobs out of America.  Now the Trans-Pacific Partnership is poised to do worse.</p>

		<h3>(Health Care)Improved Medicare for All</h3>
		<p>Having worked on the front lines of health care for nearly 30 years, Dr. Gill has a far better understanding of health care than most politicians.  As a longtime member of Physicians for a National Health Program, he has long argued against the dominance of insurance companies within our health care system.  Allowing insurance companies to run roughshod over American citizens leaves us far less healthy and far less wealthy.  Allowing insurance companies to draft the Affordable Care Act was yet another dereliction of duty by politicians who take the big contributions from such companies and then turn their backs on their constituents.</p>

		<h3>(Foreign Policy)Experts Bought and Sold</h3>
		<p>(Irresponsible foreign policy driven by arms manufacturers)As with all policy, our foreign policy has been driven by the corporate ownership of both the Democrats and the Republicans.  During his first campaign for Congress, Dr. Gill argued vociferously against the impending invasion of Iraq in 2003.  Time has shown him to have been right, as that invasion made America and the world less safe; it did enrich the treasure of a small few, though.</p>

		<h3>(Climate)Climate Change Is Real</h3>
		<p>(No Issue More Important)In the battle to leave behind an Earth which might be habitable for our descendents, we are stymied by politicians of both major parties who take large checks from Big Oil companies, and then profess to question the certain validity of climate change.  Our children in 20-40 years will be demanding answers, wondering how we could possibly have cast votes for such deniers of clear-cut scientific fact.</p>

		<h3>(Campaign Finance)Both Major Parties Work for Their Corporate Masters</h3>
		<p>(Democrats Little Different than Republicans)Even after the tremendous success of Dr. Gill's 2012 campaign, the Democratic establishment refused to support further effort's by him to secure Illinois' 13th District seat in the U.S. House. No surprise, given that Gill had long criticized the corporate ownership of the Democratic establishment.  In bowing down before the Wall Street banks and the large multi-national corporations, the Democrats have demonstrated the same lack of concerns for ordinary Americans as that evidenced by the Republican establishment for many decades.</p>

		<h3>Why Independent?</h3>
		<p>My staff and I are very excited about my 2016 Congressional campaign, and I'm especially proud to be running as an Independent.  I have long criticized both major parties for their financing by Wall Street interests, large corporations, and the ultra-wealthy.  The policies and politics of both the Democrats and the Republicans reflect this financing.  Neither party serves the well-being of ordinary Americans-- we have been abandoned.</p>
		<p>Americans recognize this betrayal, and their frustration mounts.  My criticism of our corrupted politics allowed me to upset the Democratic establishment candidate in the 2012 primary, and was crucial in my near-upset victory in the Republican-leaning IL-13 in the 2012 general election.  Our polling demonstrates that my Independent campaign will be highly competitive, in spite of the obstacles built into the system by the two major parties.</p>
		<p>Within what amounts to a one-party system, most American citizens have been without a true voice in Washington for far too long.  We deserve much better.  I look forward to discussing the issues, securing a place on the ballot, and, ultimately, to winning a majority of the votes cast in IL-13 in November 2016.</p>
